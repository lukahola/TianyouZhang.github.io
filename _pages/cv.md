Education
======
* **M.S. in Instrumentation Science and Technology, Beihang University(BUAA)** *2021.09--Present*
  * GPA: 3.81 / 4
  * Relevent Courses: Optimization Method(99), Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision(94), Image Analysis and Recognition(90)
* **B.S. in Instrumentation Science and Technology, Beihang University(BUAA)** *2017.09--2021.07*
  * GPA: 3.72 / 4
  * Relevent Courses: Automatic Control Theory(94), Engineering Optics(93), Digital Electronics Technology(97)

Experience
======
* **6-DoF Pose Estimation and Stereo Depth Estimation** *2021.09--Present*

  *Python, PyTorch* Laboratory Project
  * Accomplished tasks about monocular 6-DoF pose estimation of rigid objects from RGB images and depth measurement via two tracking cameras. Combined depth with surface normals of objects to predict their 6-DoF pose in pose estiamtion task. Method was based on GDR-Net and reached 95.79% in ADD(-S) 0.1d, outperforming the baseline at 93.7%. Currently, relavant researches are carried on about binocular stereo vision measurement for aircraft.


* **Key features extraction and reconstruction** *2020.03--2021.06*
 
  *Python, PyTorch* Laboratory Project
  * Accomplished tasks about extracting key structure features about airplane from single RGB images, and reconstructing the structure features from three views. Inspired from human pose estimation, I think about airplaneâ€™s key structures as human skeleton and annotate in the way of human pose estimation. In reconstruction process, multiple view geometry was applied in features fusion and got error at 1.469% in a new-defined Mean Per
Structure Position Error(MPSPE).

Publications
