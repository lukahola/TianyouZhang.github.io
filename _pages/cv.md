* **B.S. in Instrumentation Science and Technology, Beihang University(BUAA)** *2017.09--2021.07*
  * GPA: 3.72 / 4
  * Relevant Courses: Automatic Control Theory(94), Engineering Optics(93), Digital Electronics Technology(97)

Experience
======
* **6-DoF Pose Estimation and Stereo Depth Estimation** *2021.09--Present*

  *Python, PyTorch* Laboratory Project
  * Contribution in the first project was about monocular 6-DoF pose estimation of rigid objects from RGB images—combined depth with surface normals of objects to predict their 6-DoF pose in the pose estimation task. The method was based on GDR-Net and reached 95.79% in ADD(-S) 0.1d, outperforming the baseline at 93.7%. Currently, relevant research is carried on about reliable and accurate aircraft binocular stereo vision measurement.

* **Multi-view Images Features Extraction and Reconstruction** *2020.03--2021.06*
 
  *Python, PyTorch* Individual Project
  * Work on extracting essential aeroplane structures from single RGB images and reconstructing the structures from three views. Inspired by human pose estimation, I think about aeroplanes’ critical structures as human skeletons and annotate them in the way of human pose estimation. In the reconstruction process, multiple view geometry was applied in features fusion and got an error at 1.469% in a novel-defined Mean Per Structure Position Error(MPSPE).
