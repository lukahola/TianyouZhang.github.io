I am a final year Master's student from the School of Instrumentation Science and Technology, [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn) (expected to graduate Jan. 2024), and I earned my B.S. degree in the same department. 3D computer vision, visual measurement and interdisciplinarity with computer vision are my research interests. I am applying for a PhD position in relevant areas. More information is on the [CV](https://lukahola.github.io/tianyou/cv/) page.
