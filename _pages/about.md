I am a second year Master student from School of Instrumentation Science and Technology, [Beihang Uniaversity(BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn)(expected graduate Jan.2024), and I earned my B.S. degree in the same department. 3D computer vision, visual measurement and interdisciplinarity with computer vision are my research interests. I am applying Phd about relavant areas. More information could be found in the [CV](https://lukahola.github.io/tianyouzhang.github.io/cv/) page.
